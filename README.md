# ansible-role-borgmatic

An Ansible role to configure automated [borg] backups using [borgmatic], compatible with [rsync.net].

## Requirements

If remote servers are configured in [repository-restricted] mode, and key based authentication is enforced, a privileged key on the control node must be used to perform management of the remote backup servers. In order to protect repository integrity in the event that the control node is compromised, this key should be passphrase protected.

Once the privileged public key has been manually added to the remote backup servers `authorized_keys` file, password authentication can be disabled. For [rsync.net] this can be done using the [rsync.net web interface].

`borgmatic_remote_options`, `borgmatic_configs` and `borgmatic_restore` can include multiple items following the same structure.

For `borgmatic_configs`, if an independent `check` schedule is set, consistency checking will be decoupled from backups, otherwise consistency checks are run subsequent to each backup.

Append only mode is enforced server side, and not set at repository initialization. This allows for periodic manual pruning to save space while protecting remote integrity.

It is recommended that sensitive variables be stored in a [vault]. Variables shared between hosts can be placed in a group vault such as `group_vars/all.yml`, and host specific variables can be placed in a host specific vault such as `host_vars/inventory_hostname.yml`.

### Restoring

To restore a previous backup, set `borgmatic_restore` with restoration details:

```yaml
borgmatic_restore:
  # Repository to restore from
  - repository: user@example.com:/path/to/repo
  
    # Optionally specify the archive,
    # defaults to 'latest'
    archive: latest
  
    # Optionally specify a list of source paths 
    # from within the archive to restore
    # defaults to entire archive
    paths:
      - /home/username
      - /etc
  
    # Destination that will be restored into
    destination: '/'
```

To perform the restoration, set `borgmatic_perform_restore=true` at playbook runtime:

```sh
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e 'borgmatic_perform_restore=true'
```

## Example Playbook

```yaml
# Configure automated borg backups using borgmatic

---

- name: Configure borgmatic backups on workstations
  hosts: workstations
  roles:
    - role: interdependence.borgmatic
```

## Example `group_vars/all.yml`

```yaml
# Variables shared by all hosts

---

borgmatic_remote_public_keys: 
  - example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
  - example.com ssh-rsa AAAA...
  - example.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAA...

borgmatic_local_ssh_options: '-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa'
```

## Example `host_vars/inventory_hostname.yml`

This is a starting point for a typical Linux workstation:

```yaml
# Variables for specific host <inventory_hostname>

borgmatic_configs:

      consistency:
        checks:
